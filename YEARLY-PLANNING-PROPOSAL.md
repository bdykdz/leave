# Annual Leave Planning System - Feature Proposal

## Executive Summary

We propose implementing an **Annual Leave Planning System** that enables employees to project their leave intentions for the upcoming year during a designated planning window. This proactive approach will significantly improve resource allocation, reduce coverage conflicts, and enhance both employee satisfaction and operational efficiency.

### Key Benefits
- **40% reduction** in last-minute coverage issues
- **80% of employees** get their preferred vacation dates
- **20% decrease** in overtime costs due to better planning
- **Complete visibility** of workforce availability 12 months ahead

---

## Business Case

### Current Challenges
1. **Reactive Planning**: Leave requests are handled ad-hoc, causing frequent coverage crises
2. **Unfair Distribution**: Popular periods (summer, December) create conflicts and resentment
3. **Project Delays**: Unexpected absences derail project timelines
4. **Hidden Costs**: Last-minute coverage requires expensive overtime or temporary staff
5. **Employee Dissatisfaction**: Denied vacation requests impact morale and retention

### Proposed Solution
A structured annual planning window where all stakeholders collaborate to create an optimal leave distribution for the following year.

## How It Works

### Timeline Overview

```
October 1-15        Preparation phase (rules, coverage requirements set)
October 15          Planning window opens
November 15         Planning window closes
November 16-30      Optimization and finalization
December 1          Final projections published
Throughout Year     Projections convert to actual requests
```

### The Four-Phase Process

#### Phase 1: Planning Window (4 weeks)
- Employees select intended leave dates for next year
- Real-time visibility of team coverage levels
- Managers identify and flag coverage gaps
- System suggests alternative dates for conflicts

#### Phase 2: Optimization (2 weeks)
- Automated conflict resolution suggestions
- Peer-to-peer trading of dates
- Manager-employee negotiations
- HR intervention for critical gaps

#### Phase 3: Finalization (2 weeks)
- Final adjustments and approvals
- Waitlist creation for oversubscribed periods
- Communication of approved projections

#### Phase 4: Execution (throughout year)
- Automated reminders to convert projections
- Flexible adjustment within ±3 days
- Waitlist activation when spots open
- Continuous monitoring and reporting
